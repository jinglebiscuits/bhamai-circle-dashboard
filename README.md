# Birmingham AI Circle Dashboard

## Project Idea
- Build a lightweight, 1-page analytics experience to spotlight what's happening inside the Birmingham AI Circle community.
- Use Circle.so's headless API (or alternative data exports if needed) to surface high-level stats and timely insights.

## Guiding Questions
- How active is the community right now?
- Which spaces/channels are buzzing, and what themes are trending?
- What topics or member contributions could inspire the next meetup agenda?

## Early Focus Areas
- Participation signals: active members, post/comment volume, new members joining.
- Content themes: keywords, sentiment, or notable discussions across spaces.
- Space-level snapshots: highlight differences between core groups or channels.

## Flexibility & Scope
- Start small: a single-page view is enough; keep the stack simple and easy to iterate.
- Prioritize clear storytelling over exhaustive detail—show "what's going on" at a glance.
- Stay open to manual data collection or placeholder content while API access is sorted out.

## Open Questions
- What API access level do we have today, and what rate limits or authentication steps apply?
- Are there any must-track metrics for the founder (e.g., DMs, event RSVPs)?
- How often should the dashboard refresh, and who will maintain it?

## Next Steps (Suggested)
- Confirm API credentials and map available endpoints.
- Sketch the core layout/sections for the 1-page dashboard.
- Create a minimal data model or mock dataset to iterate on design quickly.
