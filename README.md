# Birmingham AI Circle Dashboard

## Project Idea
- Build a lightweight, 1-page analytics experience for Birmingham AI organizers to spotlight what's happening inside the community.
- Use Circle.so's Data API (plus admin access where needed) to ingest activity data, surface high-level stats, and highlight emerging interests.

## Guiding Questions
- How active is the community right now?
- Which spaces/channels are buzzing, and what themes are trending?
- Which conversations and interests should shape future Birmingham AI sessions?

## Early Focus Areas
- Participation signals: active members, post/comment volume, new members joining, returning members.
- Content themes: keywords, sentiment clues, or notable discussions across spaces.
- Space-level snapshots: highlight differences between core groups or channels and surface under-engaged areas.
- Opportunity prompts: translate the data into suggestions for next meetups or program ideas.

## Intended Audience
- Birmingham AI organizers looking for a quick "state of the community" readout.
- Stakeholders who need evidence-backed talking points to nudge engagement or plan events.

## Flexibility & Scope
- Start small: a single-page view is enough; keep the stack simple and easy to iterate.
- Prioritize clear storytelling over exhaustive detail—show "what's going on" at a glance, with actionable follow-ups.
- Stay open to interim data sources (e.g. CSV exports) if Data API access is still pending, but plan for automated pulls into a lightweight store or warehouse.

## Open Questions
- Do we have all required Data API/admin permissions and clarity on rate limits?
- Which metrics are must-have for leadership (e.g., DMs, event RSVPs, member segments)?
- How fresh should the data be, and who owns ongoing maintenance?

## Next Steps (Suggested)
- Confirm Data API eligibility, credentials, and ingestion approach (direct fetch vs. ETL tool).
- Sketch the core layout/sections for the 1-page dashboard, starting with the organizer's top questions.
- Create a minimal data model or mock dataset to iterate on design quickly, focusing on trends and actionable insights.
